1,B000GFDAUG,Mind's Clay,"I truly love the humor of South Park. It's social/political commentary and satirical wit and bathroom absurdity rules. No holds barred! I live to breathe another day in anticipation of Trey Parker's next installment whether it be South Park or some other venture. South Park is truly the work of a genius. Thank you Sir Parker. (In Britian they often ""knight"" certian individuals (usually after they are ""old"" or ""dead"") for their contributions to their society) :)Sometimes it is dry. Sometimes it is wet. And sometimes it is too moist for humor. But somebody has to do it!I would like to see new South Park episodes until the day I leave this mortal existence. However I know that Sir Parker would want to ""move on"". However I would much like to see South Park from the eyes of a 90 year old Trey Parker. What wisdom would we see then?....",5,"""More Moist Than Should Be"" Humor",1,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,Captain Barbossa long believed to be dead has come back to life and is headed to the edge of the Earth with Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann.

2,B000GIOPK2,"202_d ""202_d""",This is a cartoon series pitting eight cartoon stereotypes in a pseudo reality TV environment.I have watched all three seasons (only three are on DVD) and this one is the funniest overall. All three are worth a watch this one is best. The average price of this box set here on Amazon  makes it an affordable laugh.While it is possible to start watching with any season of this show I almost always recommend starting with season one; not too much sequential  story line.This is parody/satirical humor. This type of humor is not for everyone. The smarter you are the more jokes you will understand; some jokes are subtle.,4,"Overall, really like the series.",1,Spectre,A cryptic message from Bond’s past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE.
3,B000GIOPK2,"Alexandra Stephens ""dreamgirl0922""",Yeah drawn together is great when it comes to the crude humor. The first season was hilarious but sometimes i found the second season lacking. But it still was a great season. A definite buy is you're a fan of crude humor and hilarious cartoons.,4,Crude cartoon humor...Check,1,The Dark Knight Rises,Following the death of District Attorney Harvey Dent Batman assumes responsibility for Dent's crimes to protect the late attorney's reputation and is subsequently hunted by the Gotham City Police Department. Eight years later Batman encounters the mysterious Selina Kyle and the villainous Bane a new terrorist leader who overwhelms Gotham's finest. The Dark Knight resurfaces to protect a city that has branded him an enemy.

I hated way director changed the entire storyline.,2,not bad...,0,John Carter,John Carter is a war-weary former military captain who's inexplicably transported to the mysterious and exotic planet of Barsoom (Mars) and reluctantly becomes embroiled in an epic conflict. It's a world on the brink of collapse and Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes the survival of Barsoom and its people rests in his hands.
5,B000GIOPK2,A. Pierre,I dont agree with the reviewer who says the show wears thin after awhile. Ive watched each show about 3-5 times a piece and I cant get enough of the show its a very funny and probably one of the best cartoons on tv today. I dont know how ratings are doing for the show but if they release them via dvd i'll keep on buying them. Xandir and Tim Sitting in a Tree is my favorite of the season but all the shows are funny. The more you watch the more you pick up the little stuff you might have missed. Highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys adult cartoons its much better then South Park.,5,Excellent,1,Spider-Man 3,The seemingly invincible Spider-Man goes up against an all-new crop of villain – including the shape-shifting Sandman. While Spider-Man’s superpowers are altered by an alien organism his alter ego Peter Parker deals with nemesis Eddie Brock and also gets caught up in a love triangle.
6,B000GIOPK2,B. E Jackson,Apparently I'm one of the few who really thinks Drawn Together is a fantastic animated show.  The animation is really good overall second only to the Simpsons.  Very bright colorful animation that makes everything look very nice.  A wide variety of creative characters each with their own special personality and goofy problems.  Solid storytelling that makes the characters more interesting and a very wild adult sense of humor that has *so* much creativity you can barely keep up with the constant jumping around.  Imagine a more violent Simpsons or Futurama with the pacing in hyper mode.  That's basically what Drawn Together is all about.,5,drawn together nicely,1,Tangled,When the kingdom's most wanted-and most charming-bandit Flynn Rider hides out in a mysterious tower he's taken hostage by Rapunzel a beautiful and feisty tower-bound teen with 70 feet of magical golden hair. Flynn's curious captor who's looking for her ticket out of the tower where she's been locked away for years strikes a deal with the handsome thief and the unlikely duo sets off on an action-packed escapade complete with a super-cop horse an over-protective chameleon and a gruff gang of pub thugs.
7,B000GIOPK2,"Ben Lawrence ""Ben Lawrence""",I liked this product. I am a big fan of Drawn together and this is the best season so far. The extra features are cool and I can't wait until the next season comes out.,4,Drawn Together,1,Avengers: Age of Ultron,When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program things go awry and Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are put to the ultimate test as the fate of the planet hangs in the balance. As the villainous Ultron emerges it is up to The Avengers to stop him from enacting his terrible plans and soon uneasy alliances and unexpected action pave the way for an epic and unique global adventure.
8,B000GIOPK2,Big Dog,the show. it is really funny. it is a good show to get on Dvd. I like the show a lot.,5,it was cool,1,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,As Harry begins his sixth year at Hogwarts he discovers an old book marked as 'Property of the Half-Blood Prince' and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.
9,B000GIOPK2,Brandon Nolta,People who like cartoons must be thankful for DVDs because that technology opened up the floodgates for fans for every kind of animation. Whether you like classic Looney Tunes hippy-dippy sci-fi parables or Asian tentacle porn it's all there for you to find and enjoy. It's only been in the last 20 years or so however that American TV networks have clued into the idea that many adults like cartoons that have content specifically aimed at adults even though some cartoons did well in prime-time even fifty years ago or so. Now with DVD you can not only watch entire seasons at a shot you can also see the shows in their unadulterated glory.Which brings us to the Comedy Central series Drawn Together. I've been a fan of this show for a while partly because of the writing and partly because of the cheerful way in which it steamrolls political correctness and good taste. If South Park is the Mount Everest of crude crass animation then Drawn Together is K2; it doesn't stand as tall but it's a tougher climb. The truth of this was brought home upon watching the second season of the show on DVD. Much to my surprise watching the DVD turned out to be a different experience than watching it in first run.Part of this is due to one of the DVD set's selling points: it's unexpurgated. I didn't think this would make much of a difference as it's generally pretty clear what's been cut. As it turns out there was a lot cut out of the show and not just language: genitalia violence enough racist abuse to make the KKK turn red under their sheets sex in a vast array of configurations and a whole lot of other content that probably produces instant pucker in the unfortunate souls who work in Comedy Central's Standards and Practices department. Now I'm not one for censorship but the additional material works against the show to a certain degree. What's there is still funny in multiple senses from satire to slapstick but actually being able to hit the money words (and shots) dilutes the humor a bit.As far as taste goes DT is not a show to start novices on. If adult animation is still a new concept for you and you think The Simpsons is bleeding-edge in the sometimes fluid space between being socially acceptable and being a pariah then DT may cause seizures. For people who like edgy animation this will be just the ticket. The voiceover artists and writers take their material seriously and they're willing to go wherever the jokes take them (the season finale has a running gag with historical dates and the episodes connected to them that manages to be both subtle and sick).In terms of presentation the DT set is relatively bare-bones. The whole season of 15 episodes is crammed onto two discs leaving just enough room for a handful of interviews with the voiceover artists (minus Adam Carolla who has plenty to do outside the show) and a karaoke singalong. The visual quality is pretty sharp and the sound quality is good but this isn't the kind of material you use to do any THX certifications with so it's not like you'd expect much. Still it's the episodes that matter and for you sick little monkeys out there who like this kind of thing Drawn Together season 2 is a worthwhile expenditure. Just don't leave it out where Grandma or the kids might get a hold of it. Either you'll scar them for life (maybe shuffling Granny into an early grave) or you'll never get it back.,5,"Funny, vulgar and sick: three of my favorite things...",1,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,Fearing the actions of a god-like Super Hero left unchecked Gotham City’s own formidable forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis’s most revered modern-day savior while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs. And with Batman and Superman at war with one another a new threat quickly arises putting mankind in greater danger than it’s ever known before.
10,B000GIOPK2,Brett Rumpelstiltskin,Very adult humor cutting in sarcasm and dry take on reality shows in the least.,5,A great adult series,1,Superman Returns,Superman returns to discover his 5-year absence has allowed Lex Luthor to walk free and that those he was closest too felt abandoned and have moved on. Luthor plots his ultimate revenge that could see millions killed and change the face of the planet forever as well as ridding himself of the Man of Steel.
11,B000GIOPK2,Candi,I already had seasons 1 and 3 so I'm pretty happy that I finally got season 2. If you haven't seen the show before it's insanely offensive and hilarious. So you have been warned. Enjoy!,5,Finally completed my collection!,1,Quantum of Solace,Quantum of Solace continues the adventures of James Bond after Casino Royale. Betrayed by Vesper the woman he loved 007 fights the urge to make his latest mission personal.

12,B000GIOPK2,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""",Fans of the previous season of Drawn Together will both be overjoyed to see this DVD set & a little disappointed. Those who aren't into extremely crude humor won't be as entertained though.This season picks up with the previous's cliffhanger of the plane crash then quickly tries to top the previous season. It pokes fun at the shows & characters that it's based on as well as making jabs at it's critics. The DVD set is uncensored which is nice but some of the jokes lose a bit of their punch. Half of the fun of watching it on TV is that things are blurred & curse words are bleeped. Even so fans of this series will be glad to own this set. Anyone else? Better off renting it.,5,"Always funny, but not for everyone.",1,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,Captain Jack Sparrow works his way out of a blood debt with the ghostly Davey Jones he also attempts to avoid eternal damnation.

15,B000GIOPK2,David Meldrum,This short lived show has it's moments and some episodes are pretty decent. I would recommend this show for any adult cartoon aficionado a parody-spoof on stupid reality shows.

Well this is a great show (although not for youngsters) and the laughs just keep on coming. The special features are kind of lacking only given some commentaries and of course a karaoke sing along. There are 15 uncensored episodes including the episode ""Terms of Endearment"" which was not included in the first season dvd due to legal problems.

30,B000GIOPK2,Rmi du Crest,What more can one say about Drawn Together?! The show is self-explanatory! And season 2 is just the perfect embodiement of this. DT has no respect for anything except for the length of an episode(the 30mns format - but that's just the rule for any tv show out there 30 mns commercials included or an hour but cartoons are always using the first format).And this is really the only thing DT obeys. For the rest... Anything's game (which means laughing material) for this show. They'll stop at nothing on the road to destroying all taboos! And that's how this satiric animated show found itself a place in a rather crowded category (by quality even more than by quantity) where The Simpsons South Park and Family Guy reign. But DT pushes the limit even further nesting in that dirty area where even the other three won't go.The only limit to that strategy is that DT is burning the candle by the two ends and hadn't the show been cancelled at the end of the third season they'd probably have run out of taboos to break anyway after 4 to 5 years.But let's salute the effort and appreciate the freedom of speech of the show even if half of this liberty's wasted on filthy disgusting low-level jokes.

43,B000GIPKWY,DESERTMAN40,Mysteries of the Bible is an hour-long documentary series that was broadcast by A&E.Each; episode explored the authenticity and the accuracy of the greatest tales of the scriptures that has been bothering humanity for thousands of years.It was hosted by Richard Kellywho acted as narrator and the late actressJean Simmonswho read the Biblical quotes which provides the scriptural basis on the topic being discussed.Many expertsscientists and Biblical scholars have participated and provided their input about the scriptures and their revelations will definitely astonish the viewers.Added to thatit was filmed on the exact locations where the supposed events happened where archaeological factsevidences and surprisingly religious art were gathered.This is a joy to watch especially for viewers who want to learn more about the Sacred Scriptures.It is interestingvisually attractive and highly addictive.What's more is the fact that one will not only be enriched with knowledge not only about Christianity and Judaism but also surprisingly Islam.This will definitely make someone appreciate one's faith and religious beliefs.,5,The Documentary Series Explores Authenticity And Accuracy Of The Scriptures,1,Terminator Salvation,All grown up in post-apocalyptic 2018 John Connor must lead the resistance of humans against the increasingly dominating militaristic robots.

44,B000GIPKWY,Edward J. Barton,This set is great for the casual learner.  The set is getting dated - going back to the mid-90's but not much has changed dramatically in the field of Biblical Archeology - which is largely the premise.  The narration by Richard Kiley and Jean Simmons is pretty good though cal lull you to sleep with the dulet tones.  The content is good as well with interview of scholars archaeologists religious and others who interweave the various components together to explore some of the Bible's unanswered and unanswerable questions. The integration of Jewish and Christian thought is well done and I believe that either Christian or Jew will find this set entertaining and enlightening.  If you are a heavy duty Bible scholar this is pretty light weight.  For the bulk of us though you will learn a lot it will pique your interest and you can feel comfortable that there isn't a great religious agenda behind the shows.,4,A Good Set For The Casual Learner,1,Furious 7,Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for his comatose brother.
45,B000GIPKWY,G. Hill,I own the boxed set of this collection. Even though I was an avid fan of the show I still re-watch the DVD episodes with rapt attention.  Unlike many religious themed films this series does not promote a specific point of view. Viewers of all faiths and denominations will find that it deepens and enriches their understanding and appreciation for the spiritual lessons of the Bible. Each episode is well-rounded beautifully photographed and a complete delight to watch.The Mysteries of the Bible series weaves questions about the Biblical figures culture and spiritual meaning into a visual and intellectual feast. It combines actual footage of locations in the Bible with amazing religious art captivating narration and answers from archeology and a spectrum of Biblical scholars. It's a formula that mesmerized fans for years. Who would have thought that a show like this would so captivate the non-scholars among us?This series succeeded for so long because it recognized that readers of the world's most popular book want to know and understand more about the culture context and deeper meanings of the Bible. You won't regret purchasing any of the episodes or DVD's.

51,B000GIPKWY,"Mark ""mdippy""",This is the seven disc series offered by A&E; and still does not cover all the episodes put out by this series. I guess the remaining ones are on volume 2? Okay so the 22 episodes offered here are all interesting and informative. What I liked best about the series is that they are going on the premise that everything in the Bible is to be looked at as fact. However the series does offer the opinions of scholars that sometimes suggest otherwise and they pose some interesting facts and questions that do not always line up with archeological finds. When asked for their opinions scholars will offer beliefs that do not always line up with most dogmatic ways of thinking In other words I understood this series to be unbiased and presented the facts fairly and allowed different opinions to be heard. Many of them which surprisingly do support many held beliefs we have all been taught.When I first bought this series a few years ago I watched it but really couldn't appreciate it. Now that I am actively involved in religious education I see this series in a whole different light. It has the basic information for beginners but also has many surprising facts that I still didn't know after many years of hard religious studies. I certainly recommend this set as a supplement to anyone's religious pursuits and it makes a great starting point for discussions as well. Well put together and well presented. Thanks for doing such a great job!,5,It's a Great Reference and Review,1,Pacific Rim,When legions of monstrous creatures known as Kaiju started rising from the sea a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots called Jaegers which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes—a washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)—who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.

58,B000GIPKWY,Wildflower,I've often said religion kills.  With all my heart body and soul; I believe and worship God.  But religion? It's just like politics.  iT'S A GAME OF UPMANSHIP. Its  doctrines and dogma are man made as a way to control and subjugate people. Just like country state and city laws.  Yes some of these laws or doctrines or dogmas in my opinion are no more than means to rein in and/or subjugate people. Thus a reason to kill.In total frankness I am a practising Catholic.  Born raised and educated in all levels its schoolings; -from grammar school through college. I consider myself spiritual rather the religious.  I do not follow a priest or a preacher or churches or a religion as others do; -no disrespect intended here. Rather I prefer being a Catholic because of its universality.  Meaning to say where ever in the world I go all the sacraments and sacramental celebrations are the same. This is not to include such things as the inquisitions and church abuses. I know this invites criticism.  I am not open to debate.  Again simply put; I am spiritual and I do believe in the love forgiveness and holiness of my supreme being God my creator.

79,B000GK6NFK,heartofalion26,"I was very pleased with my recent purchase of season one of south of nowhere on DVD. I had read some bad things about this set but I bought it anyway I was a big fan of the show back then and I just wanted to be able to watch it again. I wanted to buy all 3 seasons but that would have been pretty expensive. lol I do plan to buy the other two later. But as some have already stated the theme music is different. I didn't like it at first but after you watch it all the way through you don't mind the theme music it's just strange to me that they changed it...? this is a great gift for anyone you may know struggling with their sexuality. it got me through some tough times with my own when it was on television and now I can sit back and watch Spencer's plight knowing what she's gone through already firsthand. The set is only 3 DVDs long it's a very short season that's why it's so cheap compared to season 2 & 3 but I recommend it to anyone. I really wish everyone would watch the whole season I think it would change some views of a lot of closed-minded people. All three seasons of the show depict a young girl struggling to balance between making her mother a religious woman with strong opinions happy and letting herself be who she is finding out she is. Her father a guidance counselor of sorts just wants her to be happy but he's got his own problems. The story also centers on her two brothers one adopted and looking for his birth mother and one blood brother who is trying to be a basketball star and runs into complications along the way. Ashley and Spencer are adorable together and this is above all a love story for the next generation. The set itself is no fuss no muss comes with just the box and 3 DVDs conservatively decorated but it's what is inside that counts which is hours of enjoyment that will make you go ""awww!"" and have you smiling to yourself. I would give this whole series as a gift to anyone and everyone if it weren't so expensive I think everyone should watch it it's both entertaining and helpful in understanding the plight of lesbian and bisexual people.

This should have been noted on the description; yet another case of false advertising in DVDs.  The original song is of course much more appropriate and better.There may be other unidentified cuts and alterations as the series used a lot of rather expensive music.The versions on Amazon Unbox and iTunes have the same cuts.The DVDs have several mastering errors; the ""choose episode"" option simply doesn't work.",2,"Great series, offensive DVD release",0,Poseidon,A packed cruise ship traveling the Atlantic is hit and overturned by a massive wave compelling the passengers to begin a dramatic fight for their lives.

I've seen pieces of Woody Mann's DVD on Blind Blake and as an instructor he appears to know how to communicate with someone who is trying to learn.  In other words his demonstrations are slow (but still in rhythmic time) and his explanations are meticulous and succinct.However Amazon's Unbox download is lacking a pdf tablature to supliment the video download.  This could be detramental to people who want to learn the styles Mann teaches (Lonnie Johnson Memphis Minnie etc...) but do not have the musical vocabulary or have not yet been introduced to it.My suggestion to the buyer is if you get stuck find some mp3s & online tabs of these artists works learn their phrases and then come back to this video for Woody Mann to help explain the thinking / theory behind these individual styles.  Because I know if I had not already learned one or two songs from these artists along with some basic fretboard theory I wouldn't know where to begin with this $14 purchase.Or just don't buy this video.  Spend the few extra bucks on the physical dvd and booklet.  Whatever works for you.(Note to Amazon:  The three stars is based on Amazon's poor judgement to not include pdf tabs.

153,B000GR6LBY,Benjamin C. Bernard,My original review mentioned the missing episodes on Amazon Unbox which was extremely confusing and off-putting since I did a 'one-click' season buy.  Now they have added those episodes back in (and increased the price) so my major objection is over.On the merit of the series itself this is quite a steal.  This has to be one of the all-time best Anime series especially for those who like a darker edgier anime.  This is pure young character drama here at its best.  There are mecha in this series (well one) but it plays an extremely minor role and mecha fans should not get this series on that alone (get it because it's awesome!).  I really can't recommend this story enough.If Amazon would let me change my star rating I would. (originally rated at 1-star for missing episodes).  I would give it a 3 star (5 for story but its only available on Unbox dubbed no subtitled version).Let me restate that.  This is the dubbed version of the anime not the subtitled version.

161,B000GXDJH2,Dwon,This isn't a bad video. The guy doing the work obviously knows what he's doing. I've poured concrete professionally for 15 years and I thought it would be interesting to watch someone else's technique. I feel that a sidewalk could be a do-it-yourself type of job IF you have the motivation. but if you plan on pouring a 16 x 22' drive way (especially in the summer) you MUST have someone helping you who knows about concrete. the air temperature humidity slump and wind all have a strong bearing on how the concrete will dry. Ready mix yards may suggest a retarder for adverse drying conditions but you really do need to know what you are doing. The timing of when to start finishing the concrete is never the same twice so maybe the 10 min. limit he suggested is ok or maybe not. If you fresno the surface before it's ready and the bleed water can come up you will seal it and this can result in blistering peeling and dusting of the surface which will greatly reduce the life of your concrete. I would suggest reading the ACI (ASCC1). You only get 1 shot to do it right and concrete is hard within 90 minutes of leaving the mix plant so be careful.,3,Good luck!,0,Gods of Egypt,A common thief joins a mythical god on a quest through Egypt.

177,B000H00VBQ,Ann Ueda,"I have been a fan of this show since Season One and Season Five continues the general excellence of the show.  The acting is quite solid and I am glad to see the show has been able to retain two of the show's secondary characters; while playing back-up and fill-in roles to the two main actors they add to the overall excellence.  The episodes for Season Five are all quite well written with some interesting plot twists and red herrings for those who are trying to figure out ""who done it.""  For American fans it is interesting to see how the ""Amber Alert"" system is set up in Bradfield the location for the series in ""The Color of Amber""; I did find the writing in this one episode to be at times a bit too convoluted with a few too many side stories going on.  Americans will also be interested in seeing the significant differences in policing and the widespread use of closeed-circuit TV cameras in public places that oftentimes provides crucial evidence or clues.

He empathizes with how they got the way they are instead of despising them for how they evolved from their molding circumstances. Without condescention he faces the bad (the killer) and the good (the police and innocent victims) without judging either. That could make him appear apathetic or stoic but doesn't because of the way he has a grip on the role he plays (compassionate!).

The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone"" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year   but these are an hour and a half shows  still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.

201,B000H00VBQ,phantomfan,"I've been a sort of halfhearted fan of this series since season one but season five finally won me over completely. The stories are especially compelling and original this time and less ""demented"" (despite the quote on the box!) than previous seasons. Each episode is written produced and directed in an entirely different style e.g. the first one is fast-paced with the camera never alighting for more than a few seconds while the second one is very grainy jumpy and almost completely colorless; the last episode is a bit over saturated with color giving it a sort of surreal look. This is somewhat daring but it works extremely well.Another strength of this season is the character of Alex. I really liked Carol but Alex is at least as compelling if not more so. Also Kevin and Paula as the ""minor"" characters are superbly well written and well acted.And then there's Tony who is my ""small exception."" He's as charming and likeable as ever if not more so and seems to have become a bit more compassionate and considerate of other people. (I was thoroughly charmed by the popcorn-with-Ben scene!) But a little of his eccentricity is gone. We don't really see just how much of a complete oddball he is.

204,B000H00VBQ,Ron West,It's difficult to avoid superlatives here. Production values acting narrative all add to the series's early development and to the growth of the ensemble characters particularly Hermione Norris's (then) DI Carol Jordan and of course Robson Green's portrayal of Tony Hill. As with all of the series though all of the core characters gain some detail. The cinematography deserves some notice as well particularly as this DP Dominic Clemence avoids the hand-held excesses that crop up and intrude with some later DPs. The visual element combination of scenic with close work contribute a great deal to the specific story but also add to a continued sense of mood and atmosphere. The care in production and editing doesn't jump into the foreground as it shouldn't but gives the action an excellent context. Ironically one of the producers has commented repeatedly that they long to replicate the work of American crime drama but this series is an excellent example of what the US could produce but doesn't.,5,Hard to over-rate,1,Fast Five,Former cop Brian O'Conner partners with ex-con Dom Toretto on the opposite side of the law.

207,B000H00VBQ,Stephanie De Pue,"""Wire in the Blood Season 5"" is the latest installment of the British television mystery serial based on the works of Val McDermid to reach these shores.  The series a police procedural that stars Robson Green as psychologist Dr. Tony Hill criminal profiler is produced by Green's production company for the British Granada TV: he's one of their biggest domestic stars; and the series is surely tailored to his many strengths.  It has been shown here on BBC America; but it is lacking the last episode of the series as shown here which has been spun off as a standalone.In addition to Green the series stars longtime regulars Mark Letheren as Detective Sergeant Kevin Geoffries and Emma Handy as Detective Constable Paula McIntyre.  Simone Lahbib continues her more recent duties as Detective Inspector Alex Fielding Hill's foil romantic and otherwise.  This season as most is simply advertised as ""based on characters created by"" McDermid and there is not a single episode based on one of her books. However the episodes presented are of a fairly high quality solid mysteries with some of the well-known author's intensity; some of her edginess and grit and her ability to break new ground.  McDermid of course is a leading light of the British mystery writing school known as tartan noir: and what's that when it's at home you may ask.  Unusually bloody and violent lightened a bit by that dark Scots humor.  Written (duh!!) by a Scot which McDermid is Scots-born.At any rate the series is set in McDermid's fictional ""Bradfield"" it is filmed in Manchester the actual city in which she sets her work after doing 16 years there as a journalist.  Manchester's an interesting city to use: handsome and hardly ever seen here full of interesting looking architecture with a highly diverse population.  Unfortunately the cast has been encouraged to make use of the local accent and dialect and there are no subtitles a puzzling oversight considering Green's standing at Granada.  It makes the series quite difficult to follow for us on these shores.1. ""Colour of Amber.""  A white man appears to have kidnapped a young black girl on a busy street in the morning rush hour.  A strong complex mystery dealing with interracial matters; focusing on children damaged by the adults in their lives.2. ""Nocebo.""  A sadistic ritualistic killer seems to be at work targeting children.  Another strong intense episode more daring in its treatment of blacks than an American tv program would ever be giving us a really unflattering portrait of a black voodoo-oriented preacher Dr.Kingston.3. ""Names of Angels."" A serial killer seems to be targeting attractive blond young businesswomen.  A clever perhaps too clever outing.  Notable chiefly for the introduction of a character clearly based on one of the ten-year olds who tortured and killed two-year old James Bulger in Liverpool in February 1993.  ""Christopher"" has been a patient of Hill's while imprisoned for the crime and as he was so young when he committed it he is being released as a young man.  Hill is greatly concerned with his well-being.4. ""Anything You Can Do."" Yet another apparent serial killer at work putting bags over the heads of his victims.  Another clever one but a good mystery that once again ventures where American TV will never go.  Continues the sad arc of ""Christopher"" the released Liverpool child murderer.Green is of course a handsome man and a good actor and he gives us an intense intelligent portrait of Dr. Hill.

214,B000H00VBQ,"Yvette R. Durham ""Renee""",Enjoyed this product very much. I enjoyed the increasing involment between DI Fielding and the lead character.

I also liked that we got to see a  little more of DI Fielding's personal life in this chapter.,5,Renee,1,The Perfect Storm,In October 1991 a confluence of weather conditions combined to form a killer storm in the North Atlantic. Caught in the storm was the sword-fishing boat Andrea Gail. Magnificent foreshadowing and anticipation fill this true-life drama while minute details of the fishing boats their gear and the weather are juxtaposed with the sea adventure.
215,B000H00VBQ,Z Hayes,"I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green) a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the ""cozy"" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific sometimes involving children almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling this is not really a show to watch in one sitting and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found and when further evidence turns up DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.",5,I purchased the series via streaming and loved it!,1,4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,The Fantastic Four return to the big screen as a new and all powerful enemy threatens the Earth.

216,B000H06480,"C. Wilson ""TVOD""",The previous reviewer is mistaken in thinking there are episodes missing as the first season consisted of only 10 episodes. This show wasn't even expected to be picked up for a second season on The N but the viewer response was so positive they brought it back. The shows should be watched in order to track character development. The main story line involves a teen-aged girl wrestling with her attraction to girls. Unlike most other shows touching upon this issue the character comes to terms with her lesbianism which is key to the series.

218,B000H06480,"Mark Christensen ""fushigi_nibow""","I started watching this show on a whim since I had nothing better to do.  I was hooked from the first episode even though I'm not entirely sure why.  I liked how the characters interacted.  I moved to a different community when I was fairly young but it was the opposite way.  I was going from a big city to a small farming community.  So I could relate to trying to fit in with the new community.Even if things are sometimes overdone this series touches on points that few TV shows have.  There's been a few about racism bigotry fitting in considering the future etc but this was the first time I watched a show that was made for people under 18 about homosexuality.  This is why I find it to be a progressive show since young people need to understand that there are people like this.  They don't have to exactly agree with everything but I like how the show shows them as normal teenagers which is how it is in reality.  Of course I think some parents need to see this show for the same reason.I am hoping for a DVD release and the Unbox is still missing 3 episodes from the 3rd season namely ""Can't Buy Me Love"" ""Career Day"" and ""Spencer's 18th Birthday"".

308,B000H0X79O,"T. Marie Neville ""SeriouslyFolks""",Each and every video for every season of Comedy Central drags and hangs up. The video stops while audio hums right along. Really really annoying. No other movies or tv shows play this way. I am playing these videos on TV through my Wii system. One video stops altogether and was hung up till the next day. I had to unplug the Wii to  unsung the video but every comedy central still hangs up.

310,B000H0X79O,Todd A. Brownlie,First heard his stand-up on CD when I worked at Borders a few years back.  Sometimes he gets a bit carried away (a lotta comics tend to though) and his comedy comes across dopey yet easy to relate to.  Clean (no naughty words or uncouth situations here!) family-fun comedy (dirty or clean as long as a comedian can deliver to the audience well then he/she is funny in my eyes).,4,Brian Regan,1,In the Heart of the Sea,In the winter of 1820 the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will and an almost human sense of vengeance.  The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville’s Moby Dick.  But that told only half the story.  “Heart of the Sea” reveals the encounter’s harrowing aftermath as the ship’s surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive.  Braving storms starvation panic and despair the men will call into question their deepest beliefs from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down.

314,B000H0X79O,Vincent Socci,Comedy Central always does a great job with their stand up comedians.  Sure there will be some comedians that you like more or less than others but all of them will bring a smile to your face.I appreciate that Comedy Central does keep the language controlled especially since so many comedians seem to drop those bombs so frequently. The &#34;bleeps&#34; are annoying but I would rather hear them than the swearing.  I do wish they would keep out some of the indecent topics and references.  I am not expecting wholesome child-friendly comedy but I think we should be able to expect to not be uncomfortable hearing it with friends in the room.Overall I find these quick little stand up sessions to be great entertainment while hanging out with friends or even waiting at the airport.

323,B000H0YRNY,"Amanda ""AnimeGirl""","Unlike the previous manufactured on demand (MOD) using DVD-Rs releases that had been available on Amazon this is an official release by Shout! Factory. The picture and sound on this 4 disc release is great and each disc has 5 episodes on it. Also unlike the MOD release this release has nicer main menus on the discs (the theme song plays while it loops through character images) and each episode has chapters (meaning when you click the next button it doesn't skip the entire episode). Like the MOD release this release has no extras but that won't stop me from buying the seasons 2 and 3 releases though (I love this show and I personally don't care that much if it has no extras/bonus features - extras/bonus features are just that to me an extra/a bonus especially when its only $20 -  but again that's me I know others look at extras/bonus features when making a decision to buy a DVD). The only ""flaws"" I found with this release is that on the inside of the case it lists what episodes are on each disc but it does not list them in the order they actually play on each disc (except disc 2 that one is listed in the same order it actually plays on the disc) and the cover image is from season 2 not 1. Neither of these ""flaws"" affect the great quality of the show or the DVDs of course I just wanted to mention them for those who may care and to give a detailed product review. This set does contain and play all 20 episodes of the first season in the correct order (except #2 and #3 are swapped but it doesn't affect the story or anything). Below is the order the episodes play:1.  Mystery Meat2.  One of a Kind (supposed to be episode 3)3.  Parental Bonding (supposed to be episode 2)4.  Attack of the Killer Garage Sale5.

330,B000H0YRNY,A. Steenekamp,"Danny Phantom is one of the best Nick tv shows I have ever seen. I am one of theworlds greatest fans of the series. The story of a forteen year old average simple minded teenage boy with two friends that keeps on being mocked and bullied buy theself appointed ""cool group"" of the other schollars his own age who suddenly gotghost powers by accident because his friends pushed him into going into the ghost portal that didn't function correctly when he accidently whithout noticing pressed the button inside it is brilliant! When you see the ghost that came to life inside him and created the his ghost self it is actually quite clear that he isn't just half-half but two in one. He became two and existed in two forms. His plain ordinary live human self and his live lifeless ghost self with all the powers. There are several episodes as proof of this. The first is the ""Splitting Images""episode when Danny was mistaken for being the bully by Poindexter when he took overDanny's body and drove Danny Phantom through the mirror into his world. When Poindexter got thrown back through the mirror with Danny's body into his own worldDanny tells him ""Now I want my body and my life back!"". The second time is in thecomedy episode of ""Identity Crisis"". When Danny tried to get rid of his ghost self.By using his dad's ghost catcher he seperated his ghost self from his human selfand they both got mad and acted like clowns. Another one is ""The Ultimate Enemy"" When Danny again seperated his ghost self from his human self aswell as Vlad. When Danny did this his ghost self lost all controll over himself and became furious and combined with Vlad's ghost self and since Vlad is evil and seriously wanted to murder Jack aswell as Danny Danny killed his human self. The main reason why I amso mad about this show is because of all the things his ghost self does. All thesuperhero stuff he does and adventures he has in his ghost form and all the natural obstacles he has to deal with everyday as his normal human self. Also ifyou think about it it is quite true that his normal human self will grow up get older and some time somewhere his last hour will come and he will pass away but hisghost self (who actually is also Danny Fenton but is just given a more ghostly likenickname by his human self and also to hide his true identity) will always be there looking and sounding exactly the same as his 14 year old human self becauseghosts never ages because they are lifeless. He'll even be able to attend his ownfuneral. And during the years of his adult life he'll always look like his 14 year old self whenever he goes ghost. He'll always be there for centuries to come along with all the other ghosts of deceased people like Johnny 13 Kitty Desiree Ember Mclain possibly Walker and Technus the Box Ghost etc. These are just some of the reasons why I love this show so much and why I am such a big fan of it.",5,The Teen Ghostboy,1,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,Frodo and Sam are trekking to Mordor to destroy the One Ring of Power while Gimli Legolas and Aragorn search for the orc-captured Merry and Pippin.

331,B000H0YRNY,A. Wittl,"Of course the biggest problem are the missing episodes. It's NOT the complete first season but seeing as a lot of people already complained about that I won't discuss that in detail. It just makes you feel like you've been cheated. After all the text on the DVD itself lies to you and it isn't really cheap either.Before those DVDs were ""released"" I had bought all episodes in digital form and created my own box-sets. And I have to say I actually still prefer those. The ""design"" of this DVD is just loveless everything seems simply slapped on. Every fan could make a hundred times more appealing one.The quality of the DVDs is decent but strangely enough they don't work on my player. I have a RC2-Player so it sort of figures but it never had problems with any RC1-DVD. It actually opens the DVD and shows the menu (again totally loveless doesn't even have any kind of BG-music) but it won't play the episodes. Huh. Comes with the DVD-on-demand I guess.But I knew about all those points (except for the DVD-player problem) so why did I still buy it? Because I'm a *Phan* that's why.

341,B000H0YRNY,"Christina L. Major ""Chrissykouhai""",I love Danny Phantom and I am still a fan as of now. However when I got both season 1 and 2 (or so it claims on the DVDs) I was thinking I would have all the eps and watch them even after the show was canceled. However I was very disappointed to see only just half the eps from season 1 on the first packet and the rest of it on the second one with just a few eps of season 2. My advice for all of you who love Danny Phantom and want all of the seasons don't get these DVDs. Buy them somewhere legally online and download them to your PC and watch them from there.,3,Big disappointment,0,Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief,Accident prone teenager Percy discovers he's actually a demi-God the son of Poseidon and he is needed when Zeus' lightning is stolen.

346,B000H0YRNY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"In 2004 American animator and series creator Butch Hartman had created the animated series ""Danny Phantom"".  Aired on Nickelodeon in 2004-2007 the series was produced by Billionfold Studios.""Danny Phantom"" is a series that focused on the adventures of a teenager named Danny Fenton who has parents who are well-known ghost hunters.  His parents created a Ghost Portal which would bridge the real world with the Ghost Zone but when Danny tried to use it the Ghost Portal didn't work.  But while inside the portal he turned on the ""on"" button (which his parents forgot existed) and it activated the portal.Because he was inside of the portal the portal fused with his DNA with ectoplasm and now he has been transformed into Danny Phantom.The only one that knows his secret is his best friends Sam (a goth vegetarian) and Tucker (who is a technophile and a meat-lover) but somehow Danny's parents have an inkling that one of their children may be a ghost but instead of think Danny is the ghost they think it's his older sister Jasmine.But Danny now has these powers that allow him to be a ghost which allows him to fly be invisible and eventually through the season learns that he has other powers.  And now Danny uses his powers for good against bad ghosts that are plaguing his hometown.While the series has been released on DVD before (albeit not including all episodes which frustrated ""Danny Phantom"" fans) the license for ""Danny Phantom"" has been acquired by Shout! Factory and fortunately the first season of ""Danny Phantom"" will feature all 20 episodes on DVD.Episode listing on ""Danny Phantom: Season 1' DVD are as follows (note: these are spoilerless summaries):DISC 1:EPISODE 1 - Mystery Meat  - Danny uses his new ghost powers to take on the ghost Lunch Lady.EPISODE 2 - One of a Kind  - Skulker the ghost hunter has his target set on Danny Phantom.EPISODE 3 - Parental Bonding - Danny uses his ""overshadowing"" power to take control of his dad during a parent-teacher conference.

For those familiar with this animated series ""Danny Phantom"" uses strong lines around the characters and bold colors.  In fact the series is quite vibrant and colorful and looks great on DVD.Dialogue special effects and music are quite clear coming through the center and front channels.  I chose to watch the series via stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape but for the most part picture and audio quality for this series on DVD is very good.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Danny Phantom: Season 1' comes with no special features.JUDGMENT CALL:In our household Butch Hartman animated series reigns supreme.  Every morning my young son must have his dose of ""The Fair Odd Parents"" or ""T.U.F.F. Puppy"" and before these two series he was all about ""Danny Phantom"".If anything it was an introduction for him as a young child to watch a series that brings a ghost hunter taking on bad ghosts in a hilarious and fun way.And many times I have watched this series with him and what I liked about it is that it was a series crafted not just for the kids but also for teens or adults.  These were continuous storylines that feature a young teenager with his powers and also dealing with high school bullies being unpopular but enjoying life by hanging out with friends but taking on bad ghosts.  So in a way it has a similarity to popular superhero storylines such as Spider-Man and Superman (but in a more Dr. Strange meets Ghostbusters kind of way).  And also he is a character that is not perfect and that many kids probably can relate to.Also the artistic look of the series especially with its character designs and its bold strokes will no doubt capture your attention and it's a visual style that continues today through Hartman's latest animated series.But the series has a lot of factors that make is so accessible and entertaining.  From Danny's family to his best friends but also the other characters that he meets through school or the ghosts that he encounters there's always something new in each episode and not rehash of the same stories over and over again.As for the DVD release yes this has been released before but in the past not all episodes were included.  With this latest DVD release from Shout Factory you get all 20-episodes on four DVD's and one can only hope that Shout continues to bring the other two seasons (including the specials and possibly newer episodes) on DVD as well.Overall if you were a big fan of ""Danny Phantom"" or young at heart and want an animated series with a ghost-busting storyline definitely give ""Danny Phantom: Season 1' a try!",5,All 20 episodes from the first season in one DVD release...

348,B000H0YRNY,D. P. Dahlke,When I first saw season one and two on Amazon they couldn't be ordered.  They just came back and season one is complete and in the proper order!  Episodes one through twenty accounted for.  I figure they removed it to deal with the complaints about the original discs.  There are still some minor glitches in the packaging.  They didn't change the picture with one actually from season one and there is a misspelling on one of the episodes one the back (I'll let you figure out which one).

350,B000H0YRNY,"E. HENEGHAN ""Certified Holistic Health & Nutr...",I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.

352,B000H0YRNY,Farmgal699,"First of all it is nice to see this show available on DVD especially for those of us who don't want to watch it on a 2 inch screen on an ipod.  The bad news is this is a 'print-on-demand' disc that has a lot of glitches in it.  As stated in the product description it is recorded on DVD-R discs and is a manufacture on demand product.  Although it has a slick package design complete with the Nickolodeon logo and a bar code and full color imprinted discs I still can't help but feel that this is little more than something I could have made by setting my DVD recorder to tape the show when it airs.  As a DVD-R disc it has all the glitches one expects from ""homemade videos.""  As stated in the product description it will not play in a DVD-rom or computer drive but I expected it to playback in a regular DVD player.  Uh no--my multi-disc player had difficulty reading the disc as did my portable player and it got hung up at certain points.  There was nothing more annoying that getting half way through an episode and finding that you wouldn't get to see the end because of the glitch.  incidentally if you fast-forward the disc it can bypass the glitch but you will miss the dialogue.  There are some duplication bloopers as well--for example after the commercial break sometimes entire lines of dialogue and even entnire scenes get repeated.Another important aspect is that this is not the ""complete season 1"" as the package and advertising might lead you to believe--it is actually only the first half of the first season.  The episodes are: (1)Mystery Meat (2)One of a Kind (3)Parental Bonding (4) Attack of the Killer GArage Sale (mistakenly titled ""Attack of the Garage Sale"") (5) Splitting Images (6)What You Want (7) Bitter Reunions (8)Prisoners of Love (9)My Brother's Keeper (10) Shades of Gray (11)Fanning the Flames (12)Teacher of the Year and (13) ""13"".  The first 2 discs feature 5 episodes and the last one has only 3 which seemed to be a waste of a disc.  There are no extra features or even subtitles and captioning is non existent so at the price of $30 plus it is not qorth it.  The full series is available on I-Tunes so it is not as if there is no demand for it.  If you can't wait and don't want to watch it on an ipod go ahead and purchase the disc; if you don't mind tiny graphics and a 1 inch screen go to the Itunes store.",4,"Decent DVD, but lots of technical glitches",1,Mulan,A tomboyish girl disguises herself as a young man so she can fight with the Imperial Chinese Army against the invading Huns.

353,B000H0YRNY,Flixster,"I am a huge Danny Phantom ""phan"" and have restrained myself from buying the overpriced ""dvd-r"" season copies when they were out. My patience has paid off! Now I have purchased this much more affordable official release of the first season. The first 20 episodes of the first season are included. Sadly this release is ""bare bones"" so there is no extra content whatsoever :( All that is included is the episodes themselves. The episode titles are listed on the inside of the dvd box and the dvd menu plays the theme song with scrolling art in a loop. Also the dvd case is very thin compared to most complete season boxes so it's pretty easy to store. There's not much more to say about this product. Hopefully this season will sell well so Danny Phantom phans can eventually get a second season release with plenty of extras :)",5,At last we have Danny Phantom on dvd!!!,1,Tropic Thunder,Vietnam veteran 'Four Leaf' Tayback's memoir Tropic Thunder is being made into a film but Director Damien Cockburn can’t control the cast of prima donnas.

356,B000H0YRNY,Grant M. Hortin,As the title says this set is a mixed review.The good looks like they got the COMPLETE season out not part like in the first release.The bad the physical discs themselves are cheap DVD-Rs not even real commercial quality DVDs.  This means they are very delicate and most likely will degrade in a year or two as the purple dye fades.  The authoring on them is slipshod I couldn't even play the first disc on an older DVD player without the disc skipping and the picture being pixilated beyond anything watchable.  Ended up having to watch it on my PS3.I really really wanted the series and when it's finally released it looks like a cheap pirate job.  I am sorely disappointed in Nickelodeon but unless its released on Blu-ray I hate to say this is the only way to get the series.,1,Mixed review,0,Sherlock Holmes,Eccentric consulting detective Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson battle to bring down a new nemesis and unravel a deadly plot that could destroy England.

394,B000H0YRNY,Neo Yi,"Danny Phantom did the impossible for this cynical viewer; it made me love cartoons all over again. A wonderful lighthearted gem that told the story of a boy growing up while handling his ghost powers in a children's network managed to create depth character development and story arcs that increasingly gets better each episode (unfortunately to drop by the poorly conceived Season Three).Season One starts at the beginning where we're introduced to the main cast and their eccentric personalities. Little by little the majority of them grow into their defined roles: Danny slowly gains confidence as he balances hero life with his normal alter ego his older sister Jazz realizes the truth behind her brother and supports his decision in secret while softly embracing her family's ghost life Valerie turns from a spoiled rich brat to a kick butt ghost hunter out for revenge (and later justice) etc. But truly it is the character Vlad Masters who shines with his debonair mysterious and complicated persona--his opposites and similarities with Danny all clear--a myth arc that plays a key role on Danny's struggle with darkness. There's a lot of continuity despite half of the episodes remaining as filler but since it's the first season those are meant to establish the characters and elements we all learned to love over time.THE GOOD: ""Parental Bonding"" takes in numerous subplots and mixes them flawlessly. ""What You What"" is a roller coaster look into Tucker's inferior complex towards his newly supercharged best friend delivered without hamming the emotions or loosing any. ""Bitter Reunions"" breaks the status quo and marks the beginning of the manipulatively awesome Vlad. ""Shades of Gray"" takes a pre-existing character and breathes new life into her as Valerie turns from pampered princess to hardened ghost hunter. ""Fanning the Flames"" established a solid story while making the Danny/Sam romance lovable (a farcry when Season Three makes it deplorable). ""Public Enemies"" raises the bar by having an antagonist succeed and Danny maturing to accept his duties. ""Maternal Instincts"" gives a topnotch performance between the mother/son relationship between Danny and Maddie and ""Control Freaks"" managed to prove Sam is more then just Danny's would-be love interest. But the best episode in Season One is the magnificent ""My Brother's Keeper"" which begins the excellent character development of Danny's older sister Jazz who starts off as a know-it-all constantly shielding Danny from the harsh realities of life. There she begins to see the potential in her kid brother. It is in my opinion the most sentimental and heartwarming out of all the Danny Phantom episodes.THE EH AVERAGE: ""Mystery Meat"" properly introduces the characters and backgrounds but falters in the second half with less-then-believable subplots. ""One Of A Kind"" shows the first sign of DP's use of Major Plot A and minor subplot B. ""Attack of the Killer Garage Sale"" is fine but clumsily tries to tie Danny's heroism and normalcy that others succeed better in. ""Prisoners of Love"" does a commendable job showcasing the radically different Ghost Zone but is tackled with a dumb subplot involve stereotypical rednecks and a predictable romance. ""Teacher Of The Year"" is so morally focused that it feels less Action/Comedy more Saturday Morning educational program. ""13"" is decent but lacks oomph. ""Lucky in Love"" enhances the Love Arc and boosts some secondary characters but is otherwise unremarkable and ""the Million Dollar Ghost"" has a confusing Xanatos Gambit from Vlad and a faulty father/son bonding between Danny and Jack.THE DOWNRIGHT BAD: ""Splitting Images"" which is all-around deplorable. Despite triggering Danny's Growing Darkness Arc it's meshed with a antagonist who lost his purpose halfway through the series and a jarring concept of right vs. wrong between Danny and Sam. And lastly ""Fright Night"" which degrades Danny's current growth by making him unlikeable and jerky.The DVD only covers the first 13 episodes. There are no extras but the episodes themselves are in good quality. And I will give Nickelodeon credit; they did put the episodes in their PROPER chronological order. All except ""Parental Bonding"" (episode two) and ""One of a Kind"" (episode 3) which got switched with each other. The DVD covers both front and back are also prone to error. The first volume alone for example has Danny with his ""DP"" chest insignia; something he does not receive until Season Two (partly covered in the second DVD).Hardcore fans will feel ripped off while the casual (the type who considers DVD extras more luxury then mandatory) may enjoy it. Now that the DVD contains all 20 episodes in on boxed set the once high price is slightly more reasonable but be warned that it still does not contain any extras let along subtitles.",4,A Mixed Blessing,1,Tower Heist,A luxury condo manager leads a staff of workers to seek payback on the Wall Street swindler who defrauded them.
